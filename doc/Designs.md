### Colour schemes/Typography/Navigation
Colour Scheme:\
The colour scheme for the website is clean and modern, with a predominantly white background and subtle shades of gray for the text and borders.
The navigation bar will have a black colour to create a visual contrast and make it stand out. Heading and subtitles are surrounded by a red background to enable them to stand out more and attract attention.

Typography:\
The website can use a professional and legible font combination for the text.
For headings and titles, a bold sans-serif font can be used to convey a modern and sleek look.
For the main body text, a clean and readable serif or sans-serif font can be chosen for optimal legibility.

Navigation:\
The navigation bar can be placed at the top of the webpage for easy access and visibility.
It can consist of text links, such as "Home," "About," "Jobs," and "Contact," aligned horizontally.
When hovering over a link, it can change colour or display a subtle animation to provide visual feedback.

## Alternative design
During design it is important to have an alternative design because an alternative design allows you to explore different visual styles, layouts, colour schemes, typography, and other design elements.
It gives you the opportunity to experiment and find the best combination that aligns with your website's goals, target audience, and branding.

I picked the First design instead of this alternative design because overall I preferred it aesthetics and design compared to the alterntive design. Overall I believe that the design I picked was better and would work better as the company’s new section to their website.

## Design justification
The design decisions made for the website aim to meet user needs and create a design that is fit for its purpose. 

Overall Layout and Structure:\
The design follows a clear and logical layout structure. It begins with a heading displayed prominently, immediately grabbing the attention of the users. The content is organized in a hierarchical manner, with details presented in a structured format.

Navigation:\
The page includes a navigation bar at the top, providing easy access to other sections of the website. Users can navigate to the "Home," "About," "Jobs," and "Contact" pages effortlessly. This consistent navigation allows users to explore the website seamlessly.

Typography:\
The choice of fonts enhances readability and visual appeal. Headings are displayed in a larger and bolder font, clearly distinguishing them from the body text. The body text is legible and uses an appropriate font size, ensuring comfortable reading for users.

Content Presentation:\
The page effectively presents information. The headings clearly communicates the purpose of the page. The use of bullet points enhances readability and makes it easy for users to scan the information.

Visual Elements:\
The page incorporates visual elements such as dividers, white space, and headings with background colours. These elements help break down the content into sections and improve the overall visual hierarchy. The use of dividers and ample white space ensures that the content is not overwhelming and allows users to focus on the important details.

Colour Scheme and Typography:\
The chosen colour scheme, with a predominantly white background to text and subtle shades of gray for the border, creates a clean and modern look. The use of a black navigation bar adds visual contrast and ensures its prominence. The selected typography aims for a professional and legible font combination, enhancing readability and user experience.

Overall, the design decisions made align with the user needs by providing relevant information, establishing credibility, and creating an engaging and visually appealing experience. The design elements work together to communicate the company's expertise, professionalism, and dedication to delivering high-quality web development solutions.

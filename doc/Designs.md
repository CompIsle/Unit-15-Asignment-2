The color scheme for the website is clean and modern, with a predominantly white background and subtle shades of gray for the text and borders.
The navigation bar will have a vlack color to create a visual contrast and make it stand out. Heading and subtitles are surrounded by a red background to enable them to stand out more and atract attention.\

The website can use a professional and legible font combination for the text.
For headings and titles, a bold sans-serif font can be used to convey a modern and sleek look.
For the main body text, a clean and readable serif or sans-serif font can be chosen for optimal legibility.\

When hovering over a link, it can change color or display a subtle animation to provide visual feedback.

### Alternative desgin...

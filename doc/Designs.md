### Colour schemes/Typography/Navigation
Color Scheme:\
The color scheme for the website is clean and modern, with a predominantly white background and subtle shades of gray for the text and borders.
The navigation bar will have a black color to create a visual contrast and make it stand out. Heading and subtitles are surrounded by a red background to enable them to stand out more and attract attention.

Typography:\
The website can use a professional and legible font combination for the text.
For headings and titles, a bold sans-serif font can be used to convey a modern and sleek look.
For the main body text, a clean and readable serif or sans-serif font can be chosen for optimal legibility.

Navigation:\
The navigation bar can be placed at the top of the webpage for easy access and visibility.
It can consist of text links, such as "Home," "About," "Jobs," and "Contact," aligned horizontally.
When hovering over a link, it can change color or display a subtle animation to provide visual feedback.

### Alternative desgin...
During design it is important to have an alternative design because an alternative design allows you to explore different visual styles, layouts, color schemes, typography, and other design elements.
It gives you the opportunity to experiment and find the best combination that aligns with your website's goals, target audience, and branding.

I picked the First design instead of thhis alternative design because overall i preferred it aesthetics and design compared to the alterntive design. Overall i belive that the design i picked was better and would work better as the companys new section to thier website.

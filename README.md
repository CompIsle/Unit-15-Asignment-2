This is my submission for Unit 15 Assignment 2

All documentation is in the doc folder in markdown format

The Website can be launched by opening index.html in in the /Website folder

When opeing Index.html you will open into a blank page with the text "Old/Already completed Sections".

This is Becasue in the brief for the asiignment you are asked to "create a new section for the companyâ€™s web site".

The Home page or index.hmtl  i am thinking of as the old sections of the website.

The acess to the new sections are the links at the top of the page apart from home, whcih will return you to the blank page.
